# k-Nearest-Neighbor-KNN
Implementation of KNN from scratch using Python. 

1. Extract the dataset1.zip to find the dataset
2. Run the Knn.py file

This code implements KNN algorithm from scratch. Cross validation is used on the training dataset. For selecting the best value of K, K = 1 to 11 was applied.
